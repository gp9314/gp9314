<h1>NOTES</h1>

<h3>Notes Making:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Do not underline and highlight.</li>
  <li>Read, understand and write non contextual notes.</li>
  <li>Take notes under headings. </li>
  <li>For all the subjects of prelims.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Revision:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Recall the notes under the headings. </li>
  <li>Tick marks which has been recalled. </li>
  <li>Now study the those only which you missed.</li>
  <li>Then recall again.</li>
  <li>So on in multiple rounds.</li>
</ol>

<p>The idea is read what you don’t know, leave what you know. 
The notes keep on becoming smaller, because you will keep on learning new things and very few will be left which need to be learned and it’s for the final time and the mocks. 
During mocks study which you missed.</p>

<p>I am not feeling well at my work place. The humiliation stunt which they have performed is an eye opener for me. But my policy is not to choose anything which i do not like doing. Hence i am forced to stay out of it.</p>


<h2> Multitasking: </h2>
<p> Multitasking i.e. Simultaneous work is not good at all. It shows that I am some how chasing somethign and want to become something. I do not want to become anything. This was my first decision after the M.Sc.. I didn't want to become anyone. I didn't want to prove anything to anyone. I chose to do whatever is my favourite and wanted to keep doing. I had no obligation to prove anything to anyone about the work which I have chosen out of pure love of doing. I didn't chose based on some kind of results.</p>

<p> All I wanted was to live an happy life. An happy life is summation of happy day. Be happy now to be happy in future. A happy day is nothing but doing what you love doing. Just keep  doing because you love doing. </p>

<h1>Doing vs Becoming</h1>
<p> I am aspired to do something not becoming. Becoming is stressful and not in my hand. I never become whatever i desire. The best happens when you do the best.</p>

<p>Forget about getting or becoming somethign. I do not want to become anythign. I want my happiness. I just want to do somethign witout obligation to prove result. </p>
